This is a Python project for forecasting data using Singular Spectrum Analize.
Main parts of the project:
- data source is csv files in the 'data0803' folder;
- code and modules in 'py' folder;
- configurations in the 'py/configs' folder.

Configuration defines data source used for calculation.
For debugging the algorithm and parameters you can use
several data sources - linear, sin, random.
Graphics is produced by matplotlib which is embedded in PyQt
and you can use the same navigation, zoom and other matplotlib features


Requirements: 
- PyQt for user interface,
- Matplotlib for graphics,
- scipy for math calculations.

How to use:
./py.ssa
Select configuration from 'configs' folder.
press 'Calc'.

You will see calculated coefficients for SSA.
Checkbox show checked coefficients which are optimal from
program point of view. You can change selection and recalculate.
Data graph show original and forecasted data. Use matplotlib
navigation for explore differences.
